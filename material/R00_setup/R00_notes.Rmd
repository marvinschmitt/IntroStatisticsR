# Welcome!

## Kickoff

![](../../assets/imgs/img_compass.jpg)

- Where do you feel **at home**?
- What is your **background**?
- What is your **motivation** for participating in this course?
- How would you retrospectively notice that the course was good?

## Syllabus
Let's take a look at the course website: <https://marvinschmitt.github.io/IntroStatisticsR/>

# Setup
## Installing R
**Any problems?**

Please execute in the console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
R.version
```

## Installing RStudio
**Any problems?**

Find out which version of `RStudio` you have:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version
```

## Installing the packages
**Any problems?**

Find out which package versions you have:

```{r eval=FALSE}
packageVersion("rmarkdown")
packageVersion("tinytex")
packageVersion("ggplot2")
packageVersion("tidyverse")
```

## Testfile
**Any problems?**

# R Fundamentals
## Basic usage
`R` is an **interpreted script language**, so you can just write your code into a text file and execute it line by line:

```{r}
1+2
```

**Let's try it out!**
- Open `RStudio`
- Create a new file: `File -> New File -> R Script`
- Type some expression and execute each line with `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac)

## Basic calculations
`R` supports basic arithmetic:
```{r eval=FALSE}
1+2
3-4
5*6
7/8
sqrt(9)
10**2
sin(pi/2)
log(55)
```

## Comments
If you type `#`, you start a **comment** for the rest of the line. Commented text is not evaluated!

```{r}
# This is a program that adds my two favorite numbers, namely 2 and 8.
# I thank all my sponsors and my mom for the invaluable support
# while writing this program.

2+8    # this line is where I do all the addition magic!

# End of the program
# Thank you!
```

Use comments where ever you can. Your future self will thank you!

## The help function
If you come across a command that you don't know (yet), you can use `R`s internal help. Just move the cursor to the function and press `F1`.
Alternatively, you can call `help()` and type the command you want to help for in the parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
help(log)      # Read the help for the log() function
```

## Variables
Just like in math, we often want to store numbers in variables:
```{r}
a = 5
b = 10
a+b
```

## Arrays
Arrays are vectors with homogeneous entries (e.g. only numbers or only text). Arrays are constructed using the command `c()`. We can also store vectors in variables.

```{r}
age = c(27, 28, 32, 30, 27)
institute = c('IDF', 'Slavistik', 'Germanistik', 'IDF', 'IUED')
ID = 1:5    # shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

age
institute
ID
```

***
We can do **calculations** on arrays:

```{r}
age * 365
ID ^ 2 + (ID-20)^2 - 200
age + 10 * ID
```

***
We can **access** array elements by their index with `v[index]`. The index can also be an array if we want to access multiple entries:

```{r}
age[1]
institute[c(1, 2)]
age[2:4]
```

*** 
To **append** items to an array, use this trick: Just create a **new array** with the original array as the first argument:

```{r}
age = c(age, 31)
institute = c(institute, 'Germanistik')
ID = c(ID, 6)
```

## Dataframes
Dataframes are the fundamental data structure for data sets in `R`.

```{r}
df = data.frame(ID, age, institute)
df
```

***

Add an additional column `matnr` that contains the matrical number:

```{r}
matnr = c(3324567, 4356475, 4335263, 4231526, 3324153, 3657687)
df = data.frame(df, matnr)
df
```

*** 
Access element in a data frame with index `df[row, column]`:
```{r}
df[1, 3]      # row 1, column 3
df[2, 1]      # row 2, column 1
df[1:4, 1:3]  # rows 1-4, columns 1-3
```

Access column by name `df$columnname`:
```{r}
df$age        # column 'age'
df$institute  # column 'institute'
```

***

`df$columnname` returns a `vector`, so we can handle it like one:

```{r}
df$age
df$age * 365
df$age[2:4]
df$ID + df$age
```

## Reading and writing files
You often find yourself with a data file (e.g. `.csv` or Excel) that you want to analyze in `R`. The following slides will cover:

- Setting your **working directory**
- **Writing** `.csv` files
- **Reading** `.csv` files

***

You need to set your **working directory**. That is the base path from where all your references originate.
You can set it using the `setwd()` command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:\\Users\\Marvin\\IntroStatisticsR\\material\\R00_setup")  # Windows
setwd("~/IntroStatisticsR/material/R00_setup")    # Mac
```

Print the current working directory using `getwd()`:
```{r}
getwd()
```

Use this trick to set the working directory to where your current file is located:

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))
```

***
Write a dataframe into a file using the `write.csv` command:

```{r}
write.csv(df, file='R00_student_data.csv', row.names=FALSE)
```

- `df` is the data frame that you want to save.
- `file='R00_student_data.csv'` specifies the file name relative to the working directory.
- `row.names=FALSE` controls that we do not want to save row names. That's optional.

*** 

Read a data set using the `read.csv()` command:
```{r}
df_new = read.csv(file="R00_student_data.csv") 
df_new
```

- `file="R00_student_data.csv"` provides the file name relative to the working directory.
- We save the result of the `read.csv()` command into the object `df_new`.

## RMarkdown
`RMarkdown` is a very simple way to create _beautiful_ output files for your program code. Let's head right into `RStudio` and see how we can use `RMarkdown`.

**Task:** Translate all the previous code into a `.Rmd` notebook and write some wrapper text. Use the following header: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
